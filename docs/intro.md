# Introduction

> **_NOTE:_** This is a **pre-release** of the documentation. Please send your feedback to the [Antelope IBC support channel](https://t.me/antelopeIBC).

This is Antelope's Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) smart contracts infrastructure documentation.

The goal of this documentation is to explain:

* how the smart contracts that implement the Antelope IBC infrastructure work,
* how Antelope blockchains can integrate them,
* how developers can use them,
* and why users can trust the dApps that use them. 

> **_NOTE:_** This documentation is still a work in progress. Currently, it provides documentation targeted for contract developers. Help for deployment of the Antelope IBC contract infrastructure on a particular blockchain can be currently obtained from the Antelope IBC online support and working groups.

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

* **About IBC** provides a quick overview of the Antelope IBC concept.
* **IBC Bridge** describes how an user contract on a given blockchain can know that a block or an action on a foreign (bridged) blockchain is considered final by that blockchain.
* **IBC Token** describes how tokens can be transported across two blockchains that are connected with the IBC Bridge mechanism.
* **FAQ** lists frequently-asked questions about the Antelope IBC suite.
* **Contracts** provides documentation for the Antelope IBC contract API in quick-reference format.

If you have any questions or suggestions (e.g. to improve this documentation) you can get in touch with the Antelope IBC support groups using the links at the bottom of this page.
