# IBC Token demo

This section presents the IBC Token demo app.

The IBC Token transfer demo app is a web front-end that uses javascript and that connects to running [proof servers](/bridge/proofserver.md) and blockchain API nodes on two blockchains and uses the IBC Token contracts to transfer a native token to a destination blockchain, which becomes a wrapped token, and then back.

The running demo can be accessed here: **FIXME**

The source code for the demo can be downloaded from its [source repository on Github](https://github.com/CryptoMechanics/ibc-reference-ui-html).
