# Introduction

This section introduces the IBC Token solution.

Antelope IBC Token is a complete inter-chain asset transfer solution that is built on top of the Antelope IBC Brige. It allows for any `eosio.token`-compatible asset to be securely transferred between two Antelope blockchains.

This chapter is organized as follows:

* **Overview** provides a general explanation of how to deploy and use the IBC Token solution.
* **Wraplock API** explains how to use the `wraplock` contract.
* **Wraplock API** explains how to use the `wraptoken` contract.
* **IBC Token demo** presents the demo web application that allows transfers of tokens between Antelope testnets using a mesh of deployed IBC Token bridges between them.
* **Advanced** contains a few notes on how IBC Token uses the IBC Bridge to work.
